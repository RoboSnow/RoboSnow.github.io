{"name":"The RoboSnow Team","tagline":"A PLTW EDD Group","body":"### Welcome to the 雪他　ロボット(Yukita Robot)\r\nWe are a PLTW EDD group from Shakopee High School. Between the three of us we have 8+ years of engineering classes; we are using this combined knowledge to create a robotic snow plow for our cap stone project.\r\n\r\n### Project\r\nOur project 雪他　ロボット(Yukita Robot), or 雪他 for short, is a robotic snow plow controlled by Arduino. The end goal is to have a working robot that clears a standard two car driveway, and is safer than using a snow blower. The dream goal would be to have a marketable product or have it a functional DIY project.\r\n\r\n### Current Portfolio\r\nOur portfolio is hosted on Innovation Portal and can be viewed by invite only. If you would like to see our current portfolio feel free to contact us at 234111@shakopeeschools.org \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nWe are a team of three consisting of @exedude, @tristandoo, and Tim Felker. Along side of us are our stakeholders and mentors that give us valuable information and guidance.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with 雪他?
